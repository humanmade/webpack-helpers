# Webpack Helpers

A [Human Made](https://humanmade.com) project. [![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/humanmade/webpack-helpers.svg?token=xNUfWUZqcGkpUy3iiQyu&branch=main)

## Background

A WordPress project can encompass a number of individual themes & plugins, and any of these components may contain frontend scripts or styles. This package provides reusable fragments of Webpack configurations and associated helper methods that would otherwise need to be duplicated across many project components.
