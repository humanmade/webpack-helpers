# Changelog

## v0.8.0

- **Breaking**: End support for Node v8. Node v10 or later is now required.
- **Breaking**: Update `clean-webpack-plugin` factory to reflect API changes in the latest bundled version. `plugins.clean()` can now be added to a webpack configuration's `plugins` array with no additional arguments. [#31](https://github.com/humanmade/webpack-helpers/issues/31)
- **Breaking**: Update `copy-webpack-plugin` factory to reflect API changes in the latest bundled version. `plugins.copy()` now takes a sole object argument specifying a `patterns: []` array key, where before patterns were passed as a first argument. [#96](https://github.com/humanmade/webpack-helpers/pull/96)

## v0.7.1

- Resolve issue where `{bundle name}.LICENSE.txt` files were output by Terser in situations where these files were not generated prior to 0.7.0. [#51](https://github.com/humanmade/webpack-helpers/pull/51)

## v0.7.0

- Bump dependency versions to resolve `npm audit` security warnings. [#40](https://github.com/humanmade/webpack-helpers/issues/40)
  - `copy-webpack-plugin` has been upgraded from 4.6 to 5.1.1. Consult the [breaking changes in `copy-webpack-plugin` 5.0](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#500-2019-02-20) if you utilize this plugin with any custom configuration or options.
  - `terser-webpack-plugin` has been upgraded from 1.3 to 32.3.5. Consult the [breaking changes in `terser-webpack-plugin` 2.0](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200-2019-09-05) if you utilize this plugin with any custom configuration or options. Several flags in our Terser configuration within `plugins.js` have been removed because those options are now Terser's default behavior.
